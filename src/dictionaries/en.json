The unrestricted Dockerfile does not include any proxy configuration anymore, so you'll need to configure your own proxies. Simply fill out the `RCH__PROXY__{HOST, PORT, USERNAME, PASSWORD}` environment variables on the Docker container, or read more in the [Proxies documentation](https://docs.reacher.email/self-hosting/proxies).\n\nIf you need any help, just send me an email at [‚úâÔ∏è amaury@reacher.email](mailto:amaury@reacher.email) or book a call with me below:",
